This is a Nixie Clock project I started back in 2000 and finished in 2005.

It took me 3 years to finish because I fried it twice :) That's what
high-voltage tube power supplies do to TTL logic when you short the
rails outs with a screwdriver...

Schematics are handmade and somewhat ratty, but they are what they are.

Source code for firmware included. Some bugfixes were done in 2005,
but I don't remember what they were :)

The clock still works and was repaired 3 times (floor drops that made
the chips pop out, etc.)

Nixie tubes were graciously provided by Kevin Horton in 2000.

Enjoy !
